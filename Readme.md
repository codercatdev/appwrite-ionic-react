# Getting Started with Appwrite using Ionic React

This repository contains the code for the [Appwrite Ionic React tutorial](https://devdactic.com/getting-started-appwrite-ionic-react).

## Appwrite Setup

To run the code you first need to [setup your own Appwrite Server](https://appwrite.io/).

To setup the database and collections you can follow the tutorial or use the [appwrite.json](https://github.com/saimon24/appwrite-ionic-react/blob/main/appwrite.json) file in combination with the [Appwrite CLI](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line).

## App Setup

The app is built with the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and React as the JS framework plus [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) for building a native mobile app for iOS and Android.
